                Everyone ready to complain like I don't have money to start

                desire.
                <br />
                But the one who starts working beyond those complaints is the

                <br />
                So, stop seeing the complaints, <span>hustle</span> every day,
                do whatever it takes. The success is in your doorstep.

                Whatever you speak, speak with <span>confidence</span>, speak
                louder. <br />
                <span>Don't care</span> about right or wrong. Don't care about
                "What people will say?". <br />
                People will always criticize at the beginning. They will lower
                their voice once you started to <span>speak confidently</span>.
                <br />
                You cannot be right all the time. But you can be confident. Use
                your confidence as a tool. <br />
                Don't let someone discourage you at any time. Speak so that
                people will hear your <span>voice</span>. Speak so that people
                give more <span>focus</span> to you. When your inner voice says
                "I can't", retrain it to say "<span>I can</span>".
